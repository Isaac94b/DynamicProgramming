# DynamicProgramming

## Overview

This program performs sequence alignment using dynamic programming. It uses a scoring matrix to align two input sequences based on match, mismatch, and gap values.

## Features

- **Scoring Matrix:** The program generates a scoring matrix based on the input sequences and scoring parameters.
- **Alignment Paths:** It traces back the optimal alignment paths and displays the scores.
- **Aligned Sequences:** The program provides the aligned sequences for both input sequences.

## Usage

1. **Input Values:**
    - Run the program and enter the following values:
        - Match value
        - Mismatch value
        - Gap value

2. **Input Sequences:**
    - The program prompts for two input sequences. Alternatively, default sequences are provided for testing purposes.

3. **Output:**
    - The program displays the scoring matrix, the best alignment score, and the aligned sequences.
